# 🧬 Python Blockchain for Medical Records

A simple but powerful blockchain simulation in Python to demonstrate how medical records can be securely stored and tracked using blockchain principles. This project includes custom blocks, proof-of-work mining, and transaction logging for healthcare use cases.

---

## 📦 Features

- Wallet balance tracking for users (patients, doctors, miners)
- Transaction validation to prevent overspending
- Proof-of-Work mining with adjustable difficulty
- Mining rewards to incentivize miners
- Limit on transactions per block for realistic block size
- Human-readable timestamps in blocks
- Save and load blockchain state from JSON file

---

## 🧑‍⚕️ Sample Use Case: MedicalChain

- Doctors can add health records to the blockchain
- Each record is securely timestamped and immutable
- Patients can trace their history block by block
- Hospitals receive block rewards for mining new blocks

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external libraries required (uses only built-in modules)

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project helps you:

- Understand core blockchain concepts: blocks, hashes, mining, and validation  
- Simulate a healthcare use case using blockchain for secure record keeping  
- Gain insight into how transparency and immutability can improve trust

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Flask API to interact with the blockchain via HTTP  
- [ ] Web front-end for doctors and patients  
- [ ] Encryption of sensitive health data  
- [ ] Smart contract simulation
